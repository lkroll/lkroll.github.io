## Technology, contact and about pages

For the 6th week I finished working on the individual pages for the technologies, similar to the product pages last week.

I adapted the sidebox on the right to the product pages as well, since it looks a bit more professional and offers more flexibility for different entries in the future.

Then I went on to the contact and about pages.

The design of the contact page was pretty simple but figuring out how to make the contact form work as expected and send out emails was a bit tricky at first. Luckily I found out about [web3forms](https://web3forms.com/) which makes this very trivial. #NoAd again, but the service is really good actually, and you can use it for free.

After that I did the about page. This one turned out really good:

The accordion menu for the FAQ section was the hardest part, as I wanted it to have nice animations when opening and closing sections. After watching a youtube tutorial it wasn't too hard to do using only CSS and HTML.

## Good weather and a visit

To the end of the week my mother came to visit me here in Tallinn for a couple of days.

The weather was really good and sunny until Sunday, where it began to rain and get colder again.

We spent the good weather by visiting Maarjam√§e palace, the victims of communism memorial, Pirita beach and the TV tower.

On Saturday we visited the Museum of Occupations and Freedom, which was really interesting and gave an overview about the history of Estonia during the soviet occupation and the way on how it became independent again. It is very well made and has interactive elements like a small room with a VR headset and an old russian vending machine.
