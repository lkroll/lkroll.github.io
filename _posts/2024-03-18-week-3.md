## Improving the mobile view

During the third week I mostly spent my time at work optimizing the website for mobile.
This meant making elements on the website responsive and resize properly to adapt to the smaller screen size (and width in particular).

The menu also needed to be redone to be useable on a phone:

<img src="/assets/image12.png" width="350"/>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/image13.png" width="350"/>
  <img src="/assets/image14.png" width="350"/>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/image15.png" width="350"/>
  <img src="/assets/image16.png" width="350"/>
</div>

At the end of the week I migrated the project to [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), so that I can reuse different components on differents pages and also build in some logic using Python.

Since I already have some experience with Python, this seems like a nice step to put my knowledge to good use.

I've never used Flask before, but the current Zubax website is build using Flask and it has some nice templating features using the Jinja templating engine.
It is relatively easy to learn in comparison to a fully features web framework like Django for example, which would be overkill for this project.

## Linnahall and the Baltic Sea

On Saturday the weather was finally getting better, even though it was still only about 3-5 Â°C. But atleast the sun was out, so it didn't feel as cold.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/image17.jpg" width="350"/>
  <img src="/assets/image18.jpg" width="350"/>
</div>

I took another stroll around the medieval city walls with the goal to get a glimpse of the Baltic Sea. Close to the sea is the now abandoned [Linnahall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnahall), a venue originally built for the Moscow Olympics in 1980. From there I had a great view on the Baltic Sea as well as over the city:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/image19.jpg" width="350"/>
  <img src="/assets/image20.jpg" width="350"/>
</div>

On Sunday I decided to rewatch Dune Part Two, because when I watched it in Germany I came late and missed the beginning, and I wanted to watch in IMAX again anyways.

Luckily Tallinn has an IMAX theatre, and to my surprise I could buy the movie ticket online using Bitcoin Lightning. You wouldn't ever see that in Germany ;)
