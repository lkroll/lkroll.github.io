I arrived in Tallinn the Sunday before the first week started where Kairi picked me up from the airport to bring me to my apartment.
The landlord gave me a quick "tour" around the apartment and I met my roommate who was also staying there.
As it was already pretty late when I arrived I went to bed and was excited how the first days in the company would be.
