## Individual product pages

The 5th week was all about implementing the design for the individual product pages.

This meant making a template and filling the information from different files depending on the product, so the product descriptions and details can be easily updated and maintained when I am no longer there.

The next step was to create a design for the technologies overview page.
There was no design template for this page so I had to come up with something on my own.

It is maybe be a bit too much red but I actually quite like it. Keep in mind that I am not a frontend designer or anything so this is the best I could come up with in the time I had.
I based it on the design for the products overview page to make it fit into the overall theme of the website.

## Tallinn Music Week

This week the yearly Tallinn Music Week took place, which hosted a bunch of events, concerts etc..

I took part in a tour through the Linnahall concert hall, which I have mentioned in a previous blogpost already. It was interesting to get a look inside the abandoned building and some backstory on what was once happening there and why it was initially built.

Throughout the week the weather gods decided it was too early for spring and made it snow instead.

On Sunday I accidentally walked upon the "Tallinn" sign next to the beach, which I didn't even know existed before, because it is kind of hidden when you come from inside of the city.
