## Finishing the remaining pages

In week 7 I finished all of the remaining pages and kept playing around with some minor tweaks here and there.

I started off with the blog page:

<img src="/assets/image42.png" alt="Zubax Website" width="800"/>

And after that the individual blog posts should also be shown on the website:

<img src="/assets/image43.png" alt="Zubax Website" width="800"/>

The blog posts are fetched from the Zubax Forum, all entries under the "Blog" category will be displayed on the blog page of the website. For now only the latest 9 blog posts are shown, but I may extend that to multiple pages to view all blog posts on the website instead of on the Zubax forum.

Additionally they turned out to require some manual work to fix the formatting and adjust the layout. As the blog posts include math equations and notations I had setup MathJax to render those correctly. But as you can see on the image above, in the end it turned out as expected with coherent colors and everything, thanks to a bit of custom CSS.

After finishing the blog, careers and services pages, everything was finally done!
Well not everything, but atleast every page was there. The "only" thing left now is to update all the placeholders and update the descriptions. But luckily this is not my job ;)

I also couldn't help myself and tweaked the design to make it look better in certain edge cases. For example I noticed the logos at the bottom of the first page are not always shown on narrower aspect ratios like on my 16:10 laptop, so I fixed that by using the clamp() function to dynamically adjust the spacing based on the viewport height, in other words always show the logos at the bottom even on not so tall devices.

Oh and they are animated now with a nice fade on both sides:

## Last (full) weekend

I can't believe that I now only have 1 week left here in Tallinn.

On Friday for the first time ever (I think?) I went to a barber shop in another country, what an event :D

No but it was actually really nice, you could book an appointment online and pay by card. Not something that is usually possible in Berlin.
They also spoke good English there and it was only like a 1 minute walk from my apartment, so I could easily stop by after work.

This last (full) weekend I relaxed and on Sunday went at last on the viewing platform of the St. Olaf's church. For 5â‚¬ you really get the best view of the city:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/image45.jpg" width="350"/>
  <img src="/assets/image46.jpg" width="350"/>
</div>

<img src="/assets/image47.jpg" width="800"/>

To get to this beautiful view you first have to climb up the 232 very narrow stairs, which is quite an adventure by itself. But it is totally worth it.
