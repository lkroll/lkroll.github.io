## Working on the Zubax homepage  

The last week I spent mostly rehearsing and learning the basics of CSS and HTML again, so that this week I managed to nearly finish implementing the design in code.

Luckily the design was already made in Figma so I could borrow some assets and ideas and didn't have to come up with my own design for the website. That way I could just focus on coding and making sure the website adapts to different screen sizes.

This was definitely easier said than done and the mobile view is still a WIP, but I am quite proud of what I could do in just 2 weeks. So here are a couple screenshots of the redesign:

<img src="/assets/image6.png" alt="Zubax Website" width="800"/>
<img src="/assets/image7.png" alt="Zubax Website" width="800"/>
<img src="/assets/image8.png" alt="Zubax Website" width="800"/>

It also took me a while to figure out how to implement the dropdown menu in plain CSS, but eventually I got there:

## Rainy, windy and cold

This weekend the weather dismissed any possible plans that I had.

On Saturday it was super rainy and on Sunday it was windy and very cold (-10 Â°C felt temperature, according to the weather app on my phone).

I still visited the small russian museum in Tallinn, which was more of a musem about the old house it was in. But there was also an exhibition about Aleksandr Wladovsky, who was repsonsible for the designs of many different buildings in Tallinn during the time he lived here.

Sadly it wasn't really made for international tourists and most of the text was either in Russian or Estonian, but the employees were very friendly and gave me some explanations and details in English.

And every day on my way home from work I could admire the beautiful lighting of the freedom square:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <img src="/assets/image11.jpg" width="300"/>
</div>
