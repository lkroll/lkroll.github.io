## Products page

During the 4th week I started to work on the products page.
I also added some backend logic to automatically generate the navbar for each page, to see where you are currently at:

The product showcase was the most difficult part, as it needs to be scrollable to possibly fit more products in the future and to look good and fit all products on mobile:

The mobile menu got a small upgrade as well:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <img src="/assets/image24.png" width="350"/>
</div>

## 3-day Easter weekend

In Estonia only Good Friday and Easter Sunday are public holidays, so no Easter Monday for me sadly.

But even during the holiday most shops and stores stayed open, which was kind of odd to see. The smaller shops and museums were closed, but bigger stores and chains were still open as usual.

I took my free time to rest and to go out for the time during my trip.
On Friday I went to an event at "Paavli Kultuurivabrik", which translates to "The Pope's Cultural Factory", which I found kind of funny.

Compared to Berlin the busses and trams do not operate during the night, so when I went home I just took a Bolt scooter. Did you know that Bolt is from Tallinn? That's why you can see their scooters and cars everywhere and they also offer Bolt Food for food delivery here. #NoAd

On Sunday I did a small trip to Pikakari beach and Paljassaare peninsula, as the weather was really good (for Estonian conditions, so about 13 degrees). From the beach you can have a great view of Tallinn:

Paljassaare is a beautiful conservation and bird watching area, I can highly recommend visiting it when the weather is good and you want to explore a bit of nature and the sea not too far away from the city:
