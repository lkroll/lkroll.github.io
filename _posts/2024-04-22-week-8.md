## Finishing touches

The website was basically finished already, but it turned out there were still some pages missing.

For some products there are multiple different series available under the same product name, so we needed a way to compare them.

That's were I needed to implement a new comparison page and restructure the website to allow multiple product pages under the same product name. It was a bit chaotic because the change came rather late, but in the end I managed to get it implemented:

I also added multiple pages to the blog page, so you can see all the blog posts on the Zubax website instead of heading over to the forum.

This was easier said than done, because the data that can be received from the forum only contains 30 posts for each request, but the website displays 9 per page. So I had to come up with some basic math to get it all to line up correctly.

After that I basically only added some small extra features or made some minor tweaks to the design.

At the end of the week, the website was almost ready for prime time. The only thing that was left to do was to replace all the leftover placeholders and update the new pages to show the desired content. But that can (hopefully) be done without my help.

So in the end I managed to achieve the goal of implementing the new design of the website in almost exactly the 2 months that I had.

## Last days in Tallinn

On Tuesday we had the most amount of snow in the entire time that I have been in Tallinn. I woke up to everything covered in snow:

  <img src="/assets/image50.jpg" width="350"/>
</div>

<img src="/assets/image51.jpg" width="800"/>

The last weekend in Tallinn I spent by visiting Pelgurand beach. It was still rather chilly and windy, so there weren't that many people around. But it was nice to take a relaxing walk along the Baltic Sea for a last time here.

</div>

## The END

I guess that concludes my trip to Tallinn for Erasmus+. The weather could have been better, but all in all it was a great experience that I won't forget anytime soon.
