## Arrival

I arrived in Tallinn the Sunday before where Kairi picked me up from the airport to bring me to my apartment.
The landlord gave me a quick "tour" around the apartment and I met my roommate who was also staying there.
As it was already pretty late when I arrived I went to bed and was excited how the first days in the company would be.

## Start of the first work week

On my first day I had some trouble finding the office, as there were two entrances with the same house number.
On top of that, they have just moved into a new place the week before, so there was no company label clearly visible.
Eventually I found my way and was greeted by Pavel who showed me around the office.

My first tasks were:

- assembling my desk
- setting up my workstation
- connecting my pc to the network

The last task involved connecting two ethernet cables together by soldering and adding another switch so the cable could reach far enough.
This setup took the whole first day, so only on the next day I would get to start with my main task.

### Main Task

Then I was introduced to the main task that I would work on for the next 2 months: Implementing the redesign of the new website.
