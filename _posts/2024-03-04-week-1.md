## Start of the first work week

On my first day I had some trouble finding the office, as there were two entrances with the same house number.
On top of that, they have just moved into a new place the week before, so there was no company label clearly visible.
Eventually I found my way and was greeted by Pavel who showed me around the office.

My first tasks were:

- assembling my desk
- setting up my workstation
- connecting my pc to the network

The last task involved connecting two ethernet cables together by soldering and adding another switch so the cable could reach far enough.
This setup took the whole first day, so only on the next day I would get to start with my main task.

Then I was introduced to the main task that I would work on for the next 2 months: Implementing the redesign of the new website.

## Sunday walk

On Sunday I have used the sunny (but still cold) weather to take walk and get a first feel for the city.
Just a minute from the apartment you can already see the Alexander-Newski-cathedral in the distance, so I decided to walk there and take a closer look at it.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: start; gap: 1em; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <img src="/assets/image3.jpg" alt="Alexander-Newski-cathedral" width="300"/>
</div>

Close to cathedral I also found some nice panorama spots which gave me a good view over Tallinn.
